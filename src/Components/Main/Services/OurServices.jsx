            <p>
              An IT company with a focus on cybersecurity has the capability to
              perform various functions related to information assurance,
              logical security, assessment, and authorization. Information
              assurance involves the protection of sensitive data and systems
              from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. Logical
              security involves the use of technology and procedures to ensure
              that only authorized users can access certain resources or data.
              Assessment and authorization refer to the process of evaluating a
              system's security controls and granting approval for its
              operation. With expertise in these areas, an IT company can help
              organizations protect their critical information assets and
              prevent cyber attacks. They can also provide continuous monitoring
              and response capabilities to quickly detect and respond to any
              potential threats.
